One question about the guide [Dockerizing a NestJS app with Prisma and PostgreSQL](/blog/dockerizing-nestjs-with-prisma-and-postgresql) was asked frequently: "How to run database migrations in production?"

Let's dive into this topic and find out how to use `prisma migrate deploy` with Docker for your production database.

Prisma recommends to perform migrations for production database in an [automated step](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate#production-and-testing-environments) and advises against performing it locally üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Prisma Migrate with Docker

Let's take a look at how to integrate the command `prisma migrate deploy` into the following `Dockerfile`.

<div shortcode="code" tabs="Dockerfile">

```docker
FROM node:14 AS builder

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app

# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
COPY package*.json ./
COPY prisma ./prisma/

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

# as build step‚ùì

FROM node:14

COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

EXPOSE 3000
# or during execution ‚ùì
CMD [ "npm", "run", "start:prod" ]
```

</div>

First of all, one command is very important: `COPY prisma ./prisma/`. This makes sure to **not** only copy the `schema.prisma` into the Docker image, but also includes the `migrations` directory. This is necessary as `prisma migrate deploy` only executes the [migration history files](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate#source-controlling-the-migration-history).

### Add a RUN command ‚ùå

What about adding `RUN npx prisma migrate deploy` to the `Dockerfile`?  
Two issues that come to mind are making it not a good solution.

1. Performs migration during build step, not before Docker container is started
2. CI/CD needs access to your production database, requires `DATABASE_URL` environment

`RUN` commands are executed during the build steps of your the Docker image. Time may pass between the database migration and restarting the Docker container (Nest app), leaving your database and Nest app in **different** states. Additionally, when you create your Docker image in a CI/CD pipeline, the server needs access to the production database to perform the migration.

### Add to CMD ‚úÖ

A better approach is to perform the migration just before starting your Nest app.

Nest app is started with the last command `CMD [ "npm", "run", "start:prod" ]`. [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) is not executed during the build steps of your Docker image, rather than during executing the Docker container (`docker run ...` or `docker-compose up`).

This is a multi-stage build `Dockerfile`, you need to copy the `prisma` directory including the **migration history** into the second stage.

<div shortcode="code" tabs="Dockerfile">

```docker
FROM node:14 AS builder

# build steps
...

RUN npm run build

FROM node:14

COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
# üëá copy prisma directory
COPY --from=builder /app/prisma ./prisma

EXPOSE 3000
CMD [  "npm", "run", "start:prod" ]
```

</div>


Add a new script to your `package.json` to execute `prisma migrate deploy && npm run start:prod`.

<div shortcode="code" tabs="package.json">

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "rimraf dist",
    "build": "nest build",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"test/**/*.ts\"",
    "start": "nest start",
    "start:dev": "nest start --watch",
    "start:debug": "nest start --debug --watch",
    "start:prod": "node dist/main",
    "start:migrate:prod": "prisma migrate deploy && npm run start:prod", // new script üëà
  },
  ...
}
```

</div>

Use the new script as `CMD` command

<div shortcode="code" tabs="Dockerfile">

```docker
FROM node:14 AS builder

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app

# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
COPY package*.json ./
COPY prisma ./prisma/

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

FROM node:14

COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/prisma ./prisma

EXPOSE 3000
# üëá new migrate and start app script
CMD [  "npm", "run", "start:migrate:prod" ]
```

</div>

<div shortcode="note" type="warn">
When testing locally make sure that your `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file is **not** using `localhost` as the host üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Replace `localhost` with the database container name.
</div>

Now start your Docker containers with `docker-compose up` to see the logs and verify that your migrations are performed. In case all migrations have already been applied to your database, Prisma Migrate will complete with "No pending migrations to apply.".

Hurray üéâ the database migrations are executing successfully with Docker! Test it out on your test, staging and then production environment.
